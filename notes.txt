//Parcel benifits

// Tree shaking - dead code removing 
// Javascript minifier it minimizes the js file size. Parcel uses terser to do this job
// image optimisation for svg parcel uses svgo
// html optimizer
// reduces bundle size
// browser support configuration
//caching -> everytime you save the file it takes less time to rebuild as it caches the previous build info


// Babel is a compiler which understands the JSX

//Virtual DOM is just a representation of dom not real one React uses this

//Reconciliation (diffing algorithm)-> It is algorithm to find out the different b/w dom trees to determine which parts need to be changed just like git diff .


//Why Shouldn't we use array index as key (no-key < index key < unique key)

// FORMIK for creating forms in React



// React Fiber

Coding Assignment:
1. Build the Boilerplate code using HTML, JS, React

**Imp: 

When passing children in React, we pass it using array.

Session (31-12-2022) Running Notes by me (Please add or correct if any mistakes plz):

PARCEL - THE BEAST

Parcel Features:

HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
FWA (File Watcher Algorithm)
Bundling
Minify
Cleaning our COde
Dev and Production Build
Super fast Build Algorithm
Image Optimization
Caching while development
Compression
Compatible with older version of browser
HTTPS on dev
port number
Consistent Hashing Algorithms (To do all bundling)
Zero Config (Other bundlers have much configuration)
Browser List (How to make our app work on old browsers(IE))


Read PARCEL Docs 
https://parceljs.org/docs/


Very Imp Parcel Interview Question 
Q. Should we put parcel-cache in gitignore?

Q. Why is React Fast?


**Important Interview Q. What are TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCIES?

Q. How to make our app work on old browsers(IE)? Using BROWSERSLIST

Home Work:
1. Read about dif bundlers: vite, webpack, parcel
2. Read about:  ^ - caret and ~ - tilda
3. Read PARCEL Docs from link:  https://parceljs.org/docs/
4. Read about Script types in html (MDN Docs)
5. Do what Akshay did in the class & Ignite your App on Local.

session on 01-01-2023:

Writing Scripts in package.json.

*Q. What converts New Code to Older Code(For older version Browsers)? 
A: Babel 
We do not need to write polyfill. Babel does it automatically.

npx - executing commands without downloading packages
npm - will download required packages

Note: Parcel will not remove console.log automatically. We need to configure for it. There is a package for it, named 'babel-plugin-transform-remove-console' either from babel website or npmjs website: npm install babel-plugin-transform-remove-console --save-dev /-D

Usage: 1.via .babelrc (recommended)
    2. via CLI
    3. via NodeAPI

React-key Reconciliation :
When there are siblings in an array, we need to give keys for each sibling
HW: Read about React-key Reconciliation from React Docs.

React.createElement gives us an Object, which is then converted to html and puts into DOM
JSX uses React.createElement (behind the scenes), which gives Object, and then into HTML, and it is put into DOM
Babel does it. Babel converts JSX. JSX was developed by Facebook.
Babel is must to use JSX.

Q. Is JSX HTML inside JS? No. 
A: JSX is a HTML like Syntax, and not HTML inside JS.

Babel: Compiler for JS.
Read Babel Docs: babeljs.io
Play with Babel in it's website.
Babel comes along with Parcel.

Also Go to it's GitHub Repo, and read about its algorithms.

React Component:
2 Types:
1. Functional Component- NEW
2. Class Based Component - OLD

Functional Comp is just a normal function that returns some piece of JSX, or a react element, or a function. 

Name of a Component starts with a Capital Letter (not mandatory, but good practice to use)

If we have to write multiple lines to be returned in a component, we need to use ()and ; at the end.

 For Homework, use Normal Convention.
